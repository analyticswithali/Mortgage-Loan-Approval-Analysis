# Mortgage Loan Approval Analysis 

In this study, we examine a sample of mortgage lending decision data from Boston in 1990 to determine
whether race is associated with the outcome of a mortgage loan application. Using this data, we seek to
answer the question: Do mortgage lending institutions discriminate against minorities?
